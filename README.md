# Logo-Maker

## Description:

This application was created in order to demonstrate the power of JavaScript coupled with its respective frameworks and their abilities to create various shapes.

By doing so, I have honed my JavaScript skills. With this, I have developed some plans on other projects I can program to further demonstrate my understanding of the fundamentals required to finish this challenge.
