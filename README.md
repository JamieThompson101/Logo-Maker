# Logo-Maker

## User Story:

AS a freelance web developer

I WANT to generate a simple logo for my projects

SO THAT I don't have to pay a graphic designer

## Acceptance Criteria:

GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input

WHEN I am prompted for text

THEN I can enter up to three characters

WHEN I am prompted for the text color

THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)

WHEN I am prompted for a shape

THEN I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square

WHEN I am prompted for the shape's color

THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)

WHEN I have entered input for all the prompts

THEN an SVG file is created named `logo.svg`

AND the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line

WHEN I open the `logo.svg` file in a browser

THEN I am shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria I entered

## Description:

This application was created in order to demonstrate the power of JavaScript coupled with its respective frameworks and their abilities to create various shapes.

By doing so, I have honed my JavaScript skills. With this, I have developed some plans on other projects I can program to further demonstrate my understanding of the fundamentals required to finish this challenge.
